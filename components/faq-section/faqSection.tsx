        answer:
            "Beyond Code designs and deploys operational intelligence systems that integrate AI, automation, and data infrastructure to improve execution, reporting, and decision-making within institutional environments.",
    },
    {
        question: "How are your systems different from traditional AI tools?",
        answer:
            "Our systems are built around your workflows and reporting structure, not just prompts. They automate execution, provide visibility, and support measurable operational outcomes.",
    },
    {
        question: "Can your systems integrate with our existing platforms?",
        answer:
            "Yes, we can integrate with CRMs, ERPs, internal dashboards, APIs, and cloud platforms depending on your infrastructure.",
    },
    {
        question: "How long does implementation take?",
        answer:
            "Most pilot deployments take 2–6 weeks depending on complexity, data readiness, and stakeholder alignment.",
    },
    {
        question: "Do you offer a pilot or trial before full deployment?",
        answer:
            "Yes — we typically offer a pilot engagement before full deployment. This allows us to validate workflows, and align the system with your team’s real-world processes before scaling to a full implementation.",
    },
    {
        question: "How secure are your systems?",
        answer:
            "Security is built into every layer of our systems. We follow best practices for data encryption, access control, secure integrations and reliable.",
    },
    {
        question: "Will we retain ownership of our data and systems?",
        answer:
            "Yes — you retain full ownership of your data, systems, and all operational intelligence assets at every stage of deployment.",
    },
    {
        question: "What kind of results can we expect?",
        answer:
            "You can expect streamlined workflows, stronger operational visibility, faster decision-making, and measurable improvements in efficiency, accuracy, and execution outcomes.",
